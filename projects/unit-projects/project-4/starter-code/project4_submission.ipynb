    "The original data set contained admissions factors and status for 400 graduate student applicants.  For each applicant, the GRE, GPA and ranked prestige of his or her undergardaute institution was collected along with their ultimate admission status.  The GRE corresponded to the students GRE score ranging from 200 to 800.  GPA was on a 4.0 scale, with a 4.0 being the highest possible GPA.  Undergraduate Institution prestige was ranked categorically from 1 to 4, with 4 being the most prestigious.  An admission status was recorded as either a \"1\" for admitted or a \"0\" for not admitted.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For three of the students one or more of the factors were missing, e.g., the GPA was not recorded.  These three students were removed from the data set.  Thus, the final data set used for analysis contained the complete information for 397 graduate student applicants.  Of the 397 applicants, 169 (42.56%) of the applicants were admitted.  The admitted applicants had a mean 3.48 GPA and a 618 mean GRE."

Future studies should cluster GRE scores into bands thus to better flesh out the impact of a larger change in GRE score on admisssion odds.  For example, if one thinks the chance of retaking the GRE will reuslt in just a 10 point score increase, it may not be worthwhile.  However, a 30-point increase may have a more substantial impact."
